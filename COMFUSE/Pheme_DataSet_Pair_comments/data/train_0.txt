U commit a crime, u face the law.;@yensidltaw @CTVNews Not the same thing at all. You're quite ignorant!!!;@yensidltaw @CTVNews Nope. They don't deserve that right. I can't believe you stand behind these people. Are you for real?? Very sad!!;@cdnmickeyfan wow u seriously need to learn to read and stop jumping topics. I grieve for the fallen solider and his family, but your poor..;@cdnmickeyfan he was a Canadian citizen dumbshit. What's your definition of being Canadian???;@CTVNews Anyone who is suspected of ties with ISIS should be deported. Stop the political correctness!! Enough is enough!!;@cdnmickeyfan I think you are slightly demented, just slightly. You hop topics faster than you hop dicks.

So they ARE canadian just like you and me!;@yensidltaw @CTVNews That's a joke!!!!;@cdnmickeyfan oh I get it your definition of being Canadian is one that doesn't include people of mid-east descent #thatsprejudice;@cdnmickeyfan @TheBeast_175 Sorry just saw this What u just defined is being patriotic. Which is different from citizenship (at least to me);@TheBeast_175 @cdnmickeyfan I sincerely hope that is NOT his definition of being Canadian.;@yensidltaw @CTVNews You are so ridiculous. Just listen to yourself!!;@cdnmickeyfan @CTVNews I think you are implying that this person is of Arabic background..

Glad you stand behind these people!! What about the soldier that died? Is that a joke?;@cdnmickeyfan @CTVNews bye;@yensidltaw @CTVNews They're not Canadians who were born here.

Unbelievable!!!;@TheBeast_175 Glad you think my loyalty to my country and peaceful citizens is ignorance. You're a loser!!;@cdnmickeyfan @CTVNews Me being ridiculous is your opinion. I just don't agree with your opinion. A candian is Canadian not matter what.;@yensidltaw @cdnmickeyfan judging from his responses, i think he has a hard time comprehending what he reads. Forgive him.;@yensidltaw @CTVNews Did that soldier deserve to die!!?? Whose rights are you for?? Hope your friends and family know where you stand.;@TheBeast_175 @yensidltaw You're an ignorant asshole.

Stay in your home, you don't get gassed.;@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense No problem with cops being properly equipped. "reasonably" But handing out military grade hardware ...;@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense Plenty of reputable reporters on the ground saying the cops were out of control, even local Fox affiliate;@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense How about peaceful demonstrations?
