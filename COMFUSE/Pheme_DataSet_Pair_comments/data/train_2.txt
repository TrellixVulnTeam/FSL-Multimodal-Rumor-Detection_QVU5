Enough is enough.;@manjrn @PamelaGeller Muslim kill their animals the same way as kosher. Only Kosher outright refuse to stun first.;@BearyTruth - No it was for customers. Also was problems with them serving bacon. Now the bacon I haven't heard anymore. I won't buy KFC;@BearyTruth @PamelaGeller - Kosher isn't demanded, it's made &amp; advertised doesn't blackmail.

Judged by company you keep.;@PamelaGeller Speculation! There are many products that are not Halal. This man can't love chocolate that much.;@manjrn Coz you hate Muslims? Or love bacon. Its a business, they will work towards the customer base. Don't see the problem.;@PamelaGeller @mskimrose Is that why #Walmart has caved to these terrorists &amp; carries halal products now? Americans should #boycott Walmart.;@manjrn @PamelaGeller What about Kosher?;@manjrn @PamelaGeller The ppl don't relate to the terrorist. And yet we tell them they should carry the guilt for it.

But that doesnt justify death by any means.;@MikeKrupka @agentlinton yea Police chief admitted Wilson didnt know about the robbery.;@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka but again, stealing cigars imo, arguing with a cop, etc. Hitting a cop, once hands went up, incident over;@MikeKrupka @Mikeywonteatit @Animaleyz wouldn't be so bad if they weren't already under federal interest cases;@tjholmes So why did he stop him?;@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka Plus. 5 mins walking in sandals?

I took it that the cop shot into his own car while trying to get out, causing Brown to kneel;@Animaleyz @agentlinton didn't know it was burned down? I'm not OK with that at all... still not my main concern or focus.;@MikeKrupka @agentlinton it sounded ot me like Brown was in the car, a shot, then he got out and knelt. Maybe I'm wrong;@MikeKrupka @Animaleyz I seen it yesterday. And talked to people who spoke to him;@agentlinton @MikeKrupka IDK maybe I'm having trouble understanding him;@Animaleyz not following why that's important?;@Mikeywonteatit @Animaleyz @MikeKrupka and that statement really just hurt my heart, and I am (cont);@MikeKrupka @agentlinton he said at first he shot into the car, Brown got out and knelt, then cop shot him 9 times.;@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka in the report at 1 point it says a box, another point it says a few packs. (cont);@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka so wouldn't the police car be close to the body in the pics?

Grabbed clerk...;@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka he'll be fine;@tjholmes #MichaelBrown new that he had just committed a serious crime. That is key in establishing #MichaelBrowns state of mind.;@Mikeywonteatit @Animaleyz @MikeKrupka and I'm happy for you that you haven't been exposed to this during your lifetime;@MikeKrupka @agentlinton only thing I dispute is that the police were called, and were looking for him. But Wilson didnt know about that.;@MikeKrupka @agentlinton by writing the report, he'd be providing evidence against himself.;@agentlinton @MikeKrupka this is the witness that said that;@agentlinton @Mikeywonteatit @Animaleyz wait for lawyers to help write verbiage ... but that's just what I recall, could be wrong;@Mikeywonteatit @agentlinton @MikeKrupka 5th Amendment.

Everyone should wait for facts.;@Temo4three @brunota2003 @PDPJ they do have rubber bullet rounds for rifles so you might be right.;@Bakari45 @PDPJ uh, maybe because people are rioting and trying to solve violence with violence.;@Temo4three @taylorb972 @PDPJ Stay safe!;@taylorb972 @Temo4three @PDPJ I'm watching closely, too.

Also if it was effective troops overseas wouldn't complain about it.;@taylorb972 @Temo4three @PDPJ I was thinking the same thing. But I can't tell if that's a .308.

Any more defense of him?;@taylorb972 @Temo4three @PDPJ it causes harm and death though, that is why it was made. Am I incorrect?;@Bakari45 I never once said or implied that? I said the police officers that target harmless minorities should be taken off the streets.;@AlexLittleTN @PDPJ @jonswaine guarantee those protestors pose more of a threat than supporters at a political rally.;@Mario_Greenly @PDPJ ahh good catch.;@taylorb972 @PDPJ the gun is bigger than a pistol that's the point lol lets not be too politically correct for a general statement;@taylorb972 @Temo4three @PDPJ are rubber bullet rounds in that specific weapon?;@taylorb972 @Temo4three @PDPJ Interesting.

I'll take the trade-off.;@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense Again, not even addressing people tear-gassed in their own yards.;@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense When does a demonstration turn into a mob? and any questions at all about a weird shooting is "conspiracy theory?;@jonrog1 @BI_Defense Questions is fine once the area is calmed but not during a riot, public safety limiting casualties.;@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense But you keep kind of skipping over the "tear-gassing people in their own yards";	5
