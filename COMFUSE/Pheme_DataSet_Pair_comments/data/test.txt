When an ideology resorts to murdering satirists, it is publically admitting how weak, insecure &amp; ridiculous it is. #CharlieHebdo	@AbiePB @frwololo not to justify the criminal action in Paris but the US did it previously and no body spoke about it.;@AbiePB true.

Jesus calm down I'm like 15.;@sunny_hundal there is no compulsion in religion, of course not.

And bullets are not the answer. Go to your mosques and root out the ones preaching violence.;@stephenfry And what does that achieve by showing them? #Pointless and you're not Charlie, you're Stephen.;@docslacker @stephenfry And continues to offend mainstream Muslims. It was and is 'stupid';@totalkharnage @docslacker @stephenfry That sounds like a threat.;@totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ Are firebombs and bullets are a worthy response to satire? Are you actually implying people should be silent?;@solastary @tom_wigmore_ No &amp; no. You can disagree, be offended and not advocate violence. A distinction that some on Twitter find difficult;@totalkharnage @solastary @stephenfry they were not thoughtless. You don't get it. Never will.;@tom_wigmore_ Not sure ending up dead and being firebombed is worth the laughs but that's a decision every person makes themselves.;@totalkharnage @docslacker @stephenfry was literally the point myself and others were making to be fair...;@tom_wigmore_ Oh give me a break. Just mindless platitudes that are used in the papers and news to make them look like heroes. Total tripe;@totalkharnage @stephenfry I'm not saying agree with Stephen Fry, at all.

Would you have this much angst against The Onion? They had messages to say, and they told them.;@totalkharnage @stephenfry why should there be another objective? Offense can be their objective and still be valid.;@totalkharnage @stephenfry It sounds like you are happy they were shut up. People who kill over a cartoon are the problem, not the cartoon.;@totalkharnage you're missing the point of satire. It's supposed to be borderline comedy. Those who take it otherwise need thicker skins.;@totalkharnage @stephenfry that we will not be threatened by terrorism.;@BonnettJosh @stephenfry people should be free to repost the offending cartoons, but is this a reasonable thing to do?;@solastary @tom_wigmore_ are terrorists. You make it sound like most young Muslims are terrorists which is what some in the media peddle.;@docslacker @stephenfry You mean like all the major Muslim nations have?;@totalkharnage @stephenfry offend them more. Offend Christians, atheists, Jews, Asians. Makes no difference.Who cares that they're offended?;@totalkharnage but you are saying we roll over and allow the terrorists the freedom to kill, as free expression should be repressed, no?;@totalkharnage @stephenfry You keep blaming the victim, maybe you want to look into that first.;@BaKaiyaTeru @docslacker @stephenfry apologist for what? Just because I disagree with the cartoons makes me an apologist for terrorists?;@totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ @MaxD17 @stephenfry btw what's yours?

The politically correct bullshit needs to stop. #CharlieHebdo	@JaclynGlenn @Schick1323 just a small sample;@Schick1323 @JaclynGlenn of course not all religious fundamentalism is disgusting;@JaclynGlenn I called a talk show this morning to correct them on this.

Response to horrific #CharlieHebdo murders should be to protect civil liberties not limit them.

Saying #JeSuisCharlie or "I stand with Charlie" isn't an endorsement of their cartoons, IMO. It's defending right to satirise without harm.	@CHARL3TTE I'd like people to show me examples when they say Hebdo was generalising about Muslims.;@sunny_hundal I don't have an example but I dont think I need one to say there are better ways we can show support for both speech and Islam;@sunny_hundal can you satirise the emotions of Europeans regarding Holocaust and Hitler in the same way?;@abywitter sure. Nobody can justify the killing. @sunny_hundal;@sunny_hundal @jonworth any hashtag that's widely used is going to be imperfect and inarticulate. Especially when used for broad solidarity.;@sunny_hundal @eleanor__p_ it's nice that you think so;@sunny_hundal Right to satirise without harm is endorsement of all satire, since freedom exists without limitation;@sunny_hundal that's nice for you but it's not the point.;@NicoleFroio I agree, and I think for most people saying "I stand with Charlie" is about that;@rameez_zafar satirise Hitler all you want. Hebdo did;@Babytanguera I am very uncomfortable with it, you are not alone. @sunny_hundal;@sunny_hundal my point on Huff - we are standing up 4 what makes us human.

Charlie ridiculed my faith and culture and I died defending his right to do so.;@sunny_hundal I sure hope so. Personally the hashtag makes me uncomfortable but it's just a matter of opinion I think.;@sunny_hundal indeed - we are saying no one should be killed for satire or cartoons EVER. It's irrelevant what anyone thinks of them.;@sunny_hundal u can stand up for free speech without aligning urself with a mag that satirized the ppl who get backlash from these attacks;@sunny_hundal And the cartoons should still be published. There is a difference between 'distaste' and 'I want this banned'.;@sunny_hundal I feel that it is fully possible to have solidarity for those killed and not endorse the cartoons.;	7

Police was flogging Raif. If you refuse to see that, I can't make you. @bobchurchill;@bobchurchill When you are on the hash now while it is ongoing, the end unknown, it simply seems like you are butting in. IM HUMBLE Opinion;@bobchurchill 2/2 there will still be plenty of eyes on the french hashtag after the terrorist situation has ended. Just sharing w/you;@SecularlyYours @bobchurchill Elyzcheva, "Use your limited neurons. " is caustic and counter productive.

However maybe wait until at LEAST they have caught French terrorists?;@Str8Grandmother You DO realize that while the hostage situation was underway, they were flogging Raif, right? SMH. @bobchurchill;@SecularlyYours @bobchurchill E. Listen to me, speaking to you gently. If U want to attract ppl to Raif's cause U need to not be so caustic;@Str8Grandmother I agree w/ yr example, but I don't think it's analogous. Relating Charlie and Raif shows a parallel, does not dilute.;@bobchurchill @SecularlyYours Bob it is terrible a disgrace &amp; I promise to do more, I'm actually very busy on Human Rights.;@SecularlyYours This is too confusing for @Str8Grandmother.

You;@bobchurchill @SecularlyYours Atheism is terrorism eh?;@Str8Grandmother And you need not de-link Raif from Charlie Hebdo. Wasting time asking us to WAIT instead of supporting. @bobchurchill;@Str8Grandmother No. FIFTY lashes every Friday. 1000 in total. 10 yrs in prison. 1 MILLION saudi riyal in fine. Media ban. @bobchurchill;@Str8Grandmother No. Not when they were dragging him to the mosque to flog him the same time French hostage were being taken. @bobchurchill;@bobchurchill FWIW I think it is bad form to piggyback off of the Charlie Hashtag I RT'ed several times re:Raif Just trying to help you;@bobchurchill @SecularlyYours The Police have started the assault on the Printing Plant. Hope for safety for the hostage #JeSuisCharlie;@The0Hour Has @Str8Grandmother condemned Boko Haram already or is it not the "appropriate timing" yet? @SecularlyYours @bobchurchill;@Str8Grandmother There is no time like present to link to gruesome present situations unfolding at once. @SecularlyYours @bobchurchill;@Str8Grandmother Appreciate feedback but I don't see why. Very similar issue: Islamist violence against freedom of thought and expression.;RT @bobchurchill The world must know his name. #FreeRaif #RaifBadawi #JeSuisCharlie #JeSuisRaif READ:;@Str8Grandmother YOUR timing is insensitive bcz we were trying to stop Raif's IMMINENT lashing.
